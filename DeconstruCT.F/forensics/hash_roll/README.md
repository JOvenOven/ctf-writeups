## Solution

We have two files, `encrypted1.zip` which needs a password to be opened, and `nothing.pdf` which has a snippet of [Never Gonna Give You Up](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) lyrics

It is possible to extract more information from a pdf using the command `pdftohtml`

```
$ pdftohtml nothing.pdf
Page-1
```

In the `HTML` file generated by this tool, a new line is present after the lyrics.

```

```

I tried to use that `MD5` hash as the `ZIP` file password but it did't work.

Next, I tried to crack the hash in [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) and was lucky

I used that password to open the `ZIP` file content and got the flag!

Flag `dsc{N3v3r_9OnNA_gIv3_y0u_up}`
