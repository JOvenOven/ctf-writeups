## Solution

The chal comes with a corrupted png file that is not even recognized as a `PNG`.

```
$ file magic_play.png
magic_play.png: data
```

but we know it is a `PNG` because it looks like a `PNG` when watching its hexadecimal values using the command `xxd`

```
$ xxd magic_play.png
00000000: 8957 c447 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4930 4e52  .W.G........I0NR

```

So to make it recognizable as a `PNG` file, we have to fix its `file signature` or `magic number` to the correct one, for this task I used the hex editor [`bless`](https://github.com/afrantzis/bless). We have `89 57 C4 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D` but should be `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D`

Now, it should be recognized as a `PNG` file but it still cannot be opened, to address this issue I used this online [PNG analyzer](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjB6Ye2pcmAAxU0I0QIHTXvCPkQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nayuki.io%2Fpage%2Fpng-file-chunk-inspector&usg=AOvVaw3vTMcCJlV2iwidkcNI9LlF&opi=89978449) which I like a lot because the information it shows is easy to understand.

There is a lot going on here, but let's approach the problem step by step

We know that every `PNG` file has the `IHDR` chunk following the `file signature`, so the `I0NR` chunk must correspond to the `IHDR` chunk. After, changing the type to the correct one we get this:

It seems that the chunk types after the `IHDR` chunk and before `IDAT` chunks are corrupted and need to be changed to their actual values. These could include: `PLTE` (Palette), `tRNS` (Transparency), `gAMA` (Gamma), `cHRM` (Primary Chromaticities), `sBIT` (Significant Bits), `bKGD` (Background Color), `pHYs` (Physical Pixel Dimensions), `tIME` (Image Last Modification Time) or `tEXt` (Textual Data).

Notably, `s√¶GB` resembles `bKGD`, `gAe5` resembles `gAMA`, and `hHYs` resembles `pHYs`. By changing them to the correct values, the PNG file gets fixed!
